# Ready-to-Graduate
Honeypot - IT Project II

This branch is for all uploaded csv (data) files from the Strawberry Pi's - please export your scripts into this branch. 
The Ubuntu MISP server will pull from this branch every 30 mins to import the data into the MISP server. 

There is a template file that has the headings that MISP requires for a succesful import, not all headings need to have data added. see https://www.misp-standard.org/rfc/misp-standard-core.html#name-format-2 for more details
